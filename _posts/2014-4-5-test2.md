Although the controller is not yet doing very much controlling, it is playing a crucial role. By providing context for our data model, the controller allows us to establish data-binding between the model and the view. We connected the dots between the presentation, data, and logic components as follows:

PhoneListCtrl â€” the name of our controller function (located in the JavaScript file controllers.js), matches the value of the ngController directive located on the tag.

The phone data is then attached to the scope ($scope) that was injected into our controller function. The controller scope is a prototypical descendant of the root scope that was created when the application bootstrapped. This controller scope is available to all bindings located within the  tag.

The concept of a scope in Angular is crucial; a scope can be seen as the glue which allows the template, model and controller to work together. Angular uses scopes, along with the information contained in the template, data model, and controller, to keep models and views separate, but in sync. Any changes made to the model are reflected in the view; any changes that occur in the view are reflected in the model.

				<h1>Build with a Mixin</h1>
				<p>We've included SCSS mixins used to style panels so that you can code smarter.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section section-tow">

			<div class="section section-three">
				
			</div>
			<div class="section section-four">
				You also have two options available to customize the panel within the mixin. These control the background color (which also effect border and font color) and the interior padding of the panel itself.
